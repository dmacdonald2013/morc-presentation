= Introduction
* Java Fluent API based on Apache Camel for black box integration testing (code completion)
* Arose from SolArch role needing to test integration artifacts + 3rd party SaaS, alternatives painful (SoapUI), expensive, clunky
* Runs as JUnit tests, fits in with integration artifacts

= Simple Sync Request
* Input processors, predicates, JUnit Test

= Simple Sync Request Output
* Exit code is number of failed tests (Nagios Integration)

= CXF Example
* Camel URL
* xml data validation

= Async Test Image
* Concept of expectations

= Async Test Layout
* inputMessage
* Async tests are different (fire and forget, no predicates)
* Async Expectations (waits a while for an input, ordering differences)

= Sync Test Image
* Bread-and-Butter of our integration
* explain

= Sync Morc Image
* Source of orchestration, can string together multiple expectations with ordering requirements

= Sync Test 
* xml
* json
* classpath
* multiple expectations (can handle causal ordering with asynchronous and synchronous expectations)

= Sync Test - lenient
* decouple test from implementation

= Other Features
* Groovy templates - CSV and generating many test cases
* Ordering + Parts
* Exceptions + SOAP Faults
